#This is the place to publish the models and code involved in our paper “Rethinking Unlearning in Law Large Language Model: Datasets, Methods”.

Currently, our article is under review in the journal .

We promise to disclose the pre-trained corpus (in jsonl format), the incremental pre-trained large language model (based on Yi-6B base), three forgetting datasets (legal texts Df_law, judicial interpretations Df_int, and judicial judgments Df_jud, all in parquent format), and one forgetting test set (Law300, in parquent format), in huggingface, upon acceptance. Law300, parquent format). We will also publicize the preprocessing code, incremental pre-training code and process, forgetting process, forgetting test process, etc. in this GitHub interface.


Thank you for your attention!
